Placement Assistance and Training Hub

PATH is aimed at addressing the placement process in an organisation by providing a platform 
for students to easily access job opportunities and for recruiters to find the right candidate for 
their current job openings. By utilising the power of the internet, this system provides a 
convenient way for students and companies to connect and meet their individual requirements. 
The system allows job seekers to register and update their details and skillset, and to search for 
and apply to available job openings. On the other hand, recruiters can register, post their current 
job openings, view job applicants, and screen them to find the best fit for their organisation. 
This system provides a fast and efficient way for job seekers and recruiters to find each other 
and make the right match as we will be using machine learning algorithms to predict apt 
companies for the student based on his/her score. 
PATH platform has two main components: the student portal and the company portal. The 
student portal is designed to provide students with all the necessary tools and resources to help 
them secure employment. The key features of the student portal include: 
1. Profile Creation: Students can create a comprehensive profile that includes their 
personal details, academic background, work experience, and skills. 
2. Resume Upload: Students can upload their resume to the platform, making it easy for 
companies to review their qualifications and experience. 
3. Job Search: The platform provides a search engine that allows students to search for 
job opportunities based on their skills, interests, and location. 
4. Job Application: Students can apply for jobs directly through the platform, eliminating 
the need to send resumes and cover letters through traditional methods. 

The company portal, on the other hand, is designed to provide companies with all the tools and 
resources they need to manage their recruitment process. The key features of the company 
portal include: 
1. Job Listing: Companies can post job listings, providing detailed information about the 
job requirements, responsibilities, and benefits. 
2. Candidate Search: The platform provides a search engine that allows companies to 
search for suitable candidates based on their skills, qualifications, and experience. 
3. Recruitment Management: Companies can manage the recruitment process through 
the platform, including shortlisting candidates, scheduling interviews, and sending 
offers. 

The portal has taken into account the difficulties faced by job-seekers and employers during 
the COVID outbreak, making it even more crucial to have a virtual platform for job search. We 
as a team are focused to address this issue by means of our web-based portal that saves time 
and effort of both the employer and the job-seeker in order to establish a trusted communication 
amongst one another.
